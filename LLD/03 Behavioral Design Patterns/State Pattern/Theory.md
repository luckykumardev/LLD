<!-- 
Let's explore a realistic example of the State Pattern using a context of a simple Traffic Light System. The traffic light can be in one of three states: Red, Yellow, or Green. The State Pattern allows us to manage the traffic light's behavior based on its current state.

Without State Pattern
In this approach, we would have a single class that manages the traffic light’s state with conditional logic. This can lead to a complex and hard-to-maintain implementation. -->
