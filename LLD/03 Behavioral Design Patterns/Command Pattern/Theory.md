Advantages of Using the Command Pattern:

Decoupling: The command objects decouple the remote control from the actual appliance implementation.
Extensibility: You can easily add new commands or appliances without modifying the existing code structure.
Undo Functionality: Each command object knows how to undo its operation, providing a straightforward way to revert actions.

Summary:

This example of a remote control system demonstrates how the Command Pattern can be applied to manage actions
for various appliances. By encapsulating actions as command objects, you achieve a flexible and maintainable design
