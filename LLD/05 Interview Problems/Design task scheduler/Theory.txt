Explanation
Task Interface: Defines a task with an execute method.
PrintTask Class: Implements the Task interface to print a message.
ScheduledTask Class: Encapsulates a task and its execution time, allowing for prioritization based on execution time.
Scheduler Class: Manages task scheduling and execution. It uses a Timer to periodically check and execute tasks in the PriorityQueue.
SchedulerFactory Class: Provides a method to get the Scheduler instance, adhering to the Singleton pattern.
Main Class: Demonstrates how to use the Scheduler by creating tasks and scheduling them with delays.
This code should provide a solid starting point for a Task Scheduler implementation and can be further extended based on specific requirements.
