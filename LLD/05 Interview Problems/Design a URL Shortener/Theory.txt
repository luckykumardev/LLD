Designing a URL shortener involves several components and design patterns to ensure it is scalable, efficient, and maintainable. Here's a simple Java implementation of a URL shortener and an explanation of the design patterns used.

URL Shortener Design
Components:
URLShortenerService: Main service for shortening URLs and redirecting.
URLRepository: Interface for storing and retrieving URLs.
InMemoryURLRepository: In-memory implementation of the URLRepository.
IDGenerator: Generates unique short IDs for the URLs.
ShortURL: Represents the shortened URL.
Design Patterns Used:
Singleton Pattern: Used for IDGenerator to ensure only one instance is used for generating unique IDs.
Repository Pattern: Used for URLRepository to abstract the data storage and retrieval mechanism.
Factory Pattern: Can be used to create instances of URLRepository if different storage mechanisms are implemented (e.g., in-memory, database).
