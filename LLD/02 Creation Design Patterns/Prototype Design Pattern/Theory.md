<!-- Letâ€™s explore the Prototype Design Pattern through a realistic example of creating different types of shapes (e.g., circles, squares). This pattern is useful when you want to create new objects by copying existing ones, which can be more efficient than creating them from scratch. -->

Document Editor (Shapes)
Imagine you're using a drawing tool in a document editor. When you copy and paste a shape (like a rectangle or an oval), the software doesn't recreate the shape from scratch each time. Instead, it clones the original shape, preserving its properties (size, color, etc.), and then allows you to modify the clone independently. This is a classic application of the Prototype pattern. -->
