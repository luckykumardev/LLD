The Factory Design Pattern is used to simplify and organize the creation of objects in a program. Hereâ€™s why it's helpful:

Flexibility: It allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class that should be created. This makes your code more flexible and easier to change or extend later.

Centralized Creation: Instead of spreading the code for creating objects all over your program, you put it in one place (the factory). This makes your code easier to manage.

Reduces Duplication: If you need to create similar objects in different parts of your program, the factory can handle this, so you don't have to repeat the same code multiple times.

Loosely Coupled Code: Your main program doesn't need to know the details about how objects are created. This means you can change the way objects are created without affecting the rest of your program.

In simple terms, the Factory Design Pattern helps keep your code clean, organized, and easy to update by handling object creation in a single, well-defined place.
