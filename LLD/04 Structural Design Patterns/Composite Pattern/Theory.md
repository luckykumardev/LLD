Why Use the Composite Pattern?

The Composite Pattern is used when you have a hierarchy of objects that can be treated uniformly. It allows you to build complex structures where individual objects and groups of objects can be treated the same way. This is useful when dealing with tree-like structures, such as file systems, organizational charts, or UI components.

Scenario: Building a File System
Imagine you're building a simple file system where you have files and folders. Folders can contain multiple files or other folders, and you want to be able to treat both files and folders uniformly, such as when calculating the total size or listing contents.

Without Composite Pattern

Without the Composite Pattern, you would need to handle files and folders separately, leading to more complex code
