Why the Bridge Pattern is Used

The Bridge Pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. This is particularly useful when:

You have multiple variants of an abstraction and multiple implementations: Instead of having a large number of subclasses that represent all possible combinations, you can separate the abstraction (what the object does) from the implementation (how it does it).

You want to change or extend both abstraction and implementation independently: This pattern lets you mix and match abstractions and implementations without altering existing code.
