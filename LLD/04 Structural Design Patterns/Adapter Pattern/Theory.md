Why Use the Adapter Pattern?

The Adapter Pattern is used to allow two incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two classes that otherwise couldn't interact. This pattern is particularly useful when you have existing code (or third-party libraries) that you want to reuse, but its interface doesn't match the rest of your application.

Realistic Example: Integrating a New Media Player

Imagine you're developing a media player application that plays audio files using a MediaPlayer interface. Now, you want to add support for a new audio format, but the new player uses a different interface. The Adapter Pattern can help integrate this new player without changing your existing code.
