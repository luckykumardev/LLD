<!-- 

The Decorator Pattern is used to add new functionality or behavior to an object at runtime without changing its existing structure. This is particularly useful when you want to enhance the capabilities of objects in a flexible and reusable way without resorting to subclassing.

Why Use the Decorator Pattern?
Flexible Extension: You can add functionality as needed without modifying existing code or creating many subclasses.
Combining Behaviors: Multiple decorators can be combined to create different variations of an object.
Single Responsibility: Each decorator has a specific responsibility, promoting a clean design.
Example Scenario: Coffee Shop
Let's say you have a simple coffee shop application where you can order different types of coffee. We'll first see how it works without using the Decorator Pattern and then how it can be improved using it.
