<!-- 

The Facade Pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with that subsystem without needing to understand its internal workings. It helps reduce dependencies and promotes loose coupling by hiding the complexities of the system.

Why Use the Facade Pattern?

Simplified Interface: It provides a simple interface for the client to use, reducing the learning curve.
Decoupling: Clients are decoupled from the complex subsystem, which makes the system easier to maintain and evolve.
Reduced Complexity: It hides the complexities of the subsystem, making the code cleaner and easier to read.
